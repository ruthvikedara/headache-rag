Do migraines or headaches cause any damage to my brain?,"There has not been any proven research showing that migraines or headaches cause brain damage. Some research evidence has shown that sufferers of migraine with aura (seeing flashing lights, wavy lines, dots, or blurry vision, or blind spots, 20-60 minutes before a migraine) have an increased risk of stroke. However, in young people with NO other risk factors (e.g. high blood pressure, obesity, history of smoking, etc.) the risk of stroke is minimal."
"Why is it when my neck is painful, my head starts to hurt?","This is what we call a cervicogenic headache. The joints of our spine around our neck and the muscles surrounding it connect to our head.  When we have stiffness around our neck and shoulders (from our spine or our muscles), they can cause the radiation of pain from the neck to our head. Keeping our head and neck in static positions, such as looking too long at the computer screen, can trigger that tension and stiffness, resulting in headaches."
I feel tired all the time. Is it related to my headaches?,"You might want to ask yourself several questions when you’re feeling tired all the time: Are you getting enough uninterrupted.sleep at night? Are you drinking enough water (At least 2 litres) per day? Are you currently taking any medication? How are your mental and emotional stress levels? Inadequate sleep and hydration are lifestyle factors that influence headaches a lot. Lack of sleep and hydration may cause constriction of small blood vessels around your head and neck, and result in the tiredness that you feel as well as headaches. Certain medications such as allergy or flu medication may cause drowsiness.
Mental and emotional stress causes tension around the muscles of your head and neck resulting in physical fatigue, but can also result in mental fatigue. Over the long term, mental fatigue can result in burnout and physical symptoms like headaches or nausea."
Does weather have any effect on headaches?,"Heat-induced headaches (such as a headache after you’ve been walking outside in the hot sun) can be partly due to dehydration. If you have a history of migraines, bright light and sudden changes in temperature can be a trigger for migraines.
To determine whether your headache is due to dehydration from the hot weather, drink a few glasses of water or juice (not caffeine or soda!) and see if your headache goes off in 30 minutes to 2 hours. If it doesn’t, it may be a migraine trigger for you."
Why do my headaches get worse when I’m on my period?,"Hormonal changes during your period can be a trigger for migraines due to changing levels of estrogen and progesterone. The use of heat packs, gentle neck stretches and exercises, and lifestyle factors such as reducing caffeine and getting enough sleep can help regulate these changes. If migraines during your period are severe enough to stop you from going about your daily life, please consult a doctor for further advice!"
I find myself having to take painkillers often… Are there any side effects to my body?,"Long-term use of painkillers to relieve your headache can cause over-dependence and you may get used to the dosage, causing you to take a higher dosage to get relief. Too much painkiller use over long periods of time may result in liver damage. If your painkiller of choice is a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), it may result in bleeding of your stomach lining. If you find yourself having to take painkillers regularly (multiple times a week) to relieve your headaches, please consult a doctor to further determine the cause of your severe headaches."
Are there any treatments which are non-medication based that are effective?,"A physiotherapist can help by teaching you certain relaxation methods, exercises, and stretches around the shoulder, neck and head so you learn to manage and prevent headaches. Adjustments by a chiropractor can help to modulate pain mechanisms and reduce headaches. Other alternative treatments such as acupuncture and massage have also been shown to bring relief. Discuss it with your trusted healthcare professional to start identifying what treatments will be best suited for your condition and body!"
Will the headaches ever completely disappear?,"Whether it will completely disappear depends on the cause of your headaches. Understanding the cause of your headaches/migraines, as well as your triggers, will be very helpful in managing the occurrence and severity of it. With lifestyle changes, preventing triggering factors, and knowing ways to stretch, move, or even breathe, can go a long way in minimising the effect of headaches in your life with minimal medication use."
Is there anything I can do NOW to help?,"Of course! First: Get enough sleep and hydration. Second: Get moving and breathing right. 
Here are stretches to try out when you’re feeling the tension around your head and neck:
Breathing is also a big factor in reducing headaches if your triggers are muscle tension and stress. Focusing on belly breathing can help to reduce the tension around our shoulders, neck, and head, and be an exercise that we use to prevent headaches. Head on over to our post “Improve your breathing for a healthier life” to find out if you’re a belly breather or chest breather."

"Doctor, I get headaches often. Is it just stress from work and life, or could it be something more serious?","Headaches are indeed common and can often be attributed to stress, lack of sleep, or other lifestyle factors. However, frequent headaches can sometimes indicate underlying health issues. While most headaches are not serious, it's important to pay attention to any changes in frequency, intensity, or associated symptoms. If your headaches are persistent, severe, or accompanied by other symptoms like vision changes, weakness, or confusion, it's crucial to consult a doctor for a proper evaluation."
Many people around me also complain of headaches. Is there something in our environment or lifestyle causing this?,"It's not uncommon for people in the same environment to experience similar health issues. Several environmental factors could contribute to headaches, including air pollution, noise pollution, and high stress levels associated with city life. Additionally, shared lifestyle factors like long work hours, irregular sleep patterns, or common dietary habits might play a role. However, it's important to remember that headaches can have various causes, and what affects one person might not affect another in the same way. "
I can't afford to miss work. Are there any quick and effective treatments that won't make me drowsy?,"There are several over-the-counter pain relievers that can effectively treat headaches without causing significant drowsiness. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or naproxen, or pain relievers like paracetamol, can be effective for many people. Some formulations are specifically designed for headache relief and may include caffeine, which can enhance their effectiveness. However, it's important not to overuse these medications as they can lead to rebound headaches if taken too frequently. Non-medicinal approaches like staying hydrated, practicing relaxation techniques, or using cold or hot compresses can also provide relief without side effects. If your headaches are frequent or severe enough to impact your work regularly, it's advisable to consult a doctor for a more comprehensive treatment plan."
"I work long hours, often in the sun or in noisy environments. Could this be triggering my headaches?","Yes, your work environment could indeed be contributing to your headaches. Prolonged exposure to sun can lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion, both of which can trigger headaches. Similarly, constant exposure to loud noise can cause tension headaches or migraines in some people. Additionally, long work hours can lead to eye strain, poor posture, and increased stress levels, all of which are known headache triggers. To mitigate these factors, try to take regular breaks, stay hydrated, use sun protection, and if possible, use ear protection in noisy environments."
I can't afford expensive tests. Are there simple ways to figure out what kind of headache I have?,"While detailed diagnostic tests can be helpful, many types of headaches can be identified through a thorough discussion of your symptoms and medical history with a healthcare provider. Keeping a headache diary can be an invaluable tool in this process. Note down when your headaches occur, their duration, intensity, location, any associated symptoms, and potential triggers (like certain foods, activities, or environmental factors). This information can help your doctor identify patterns and make a diagnosis without necessarily resorting to expensive tests. However, if your headaches are severe, sudden, or accompanied by worrying symptoms, we might recommend further testing to rule out more serious conditions."
My headaches are often on one side and throbbing. What does that mean?,"The symptoms you describe are characteristic of migraine headaches. Migraines typically cause moderate to severe pain, often on one side of the head, with a throbbing or pulsating quality. They can last from a few hours to several days and may be accompanied by other symptoms like sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, or visual disturbances. While migraines are common and not usually dangerous, they can significantly impact quality of life. If you're experiencing these symptoms regularly, it's advisable to consult with our neurologists. "
Sometimes my head feels like it's in a vice. What can I do to relieve that kind of pain?,"The sensation you're describing is typical of tension headaches, which are very common. This crushing feeling often results from muscle tension in the head, neck, and shoulders. To relieve this type of pain, you can try several approaches: \n
a) Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.\n
b) Apply a warm or cool compress to your forehead or neck.\n
c) Gently massage your temples and neck muscles.\n
d) Take short breaks from work to stretch and move around.\n
e) Ensure you're staying hydrated and getting enough sleep.\n
f) Over-the-counter pain relievers like paracetamol or ibuprofen can help."
My headaches are sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Is that normal?,"While headaches with nausea and vomiting can be distressing, they are not uncommon, especially in migraine headaches. Migraines often involve not just head pain but also other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound.
However, it's important to note that severe headaches with nausea and vomiting can sometimes indicate more serious conditions. If these symptoms are new for you, particularly severe, or accompanied by other worrying signs like fever, stiff neck, confusion, or the worst headache of your life, you should seek immediate medical attention."
"I've noticed my headaches are worse during certain times of the month, could it be related to my hormones?","Yes, hormonal changes can indeed trigger headaches, particularly in women. If you're noticing a pattern related to your menstrual cycle, you might be experiencing menstrual migraines or hormone-related headaches. These often occur before or during menstruation, when estrogen levels drop. If you suspect your headaches are hormone-related, keeping a detailed headache diary can be very helpful. Note the dates of your headaches along with your menstrual cycle. This information can help us determine if there's a hormonal link and suggest appropriate treatments, which might include hormonal therapies or timing your preventive medications with your cycle."
My vision gets blurry before the headache starts. Should I be worried about that?,"This sounds like a migraine aura. While generally not dangerous, it's important to have these symptoms evaluated, especially if new. You should seek immediate medical attention if accompanied by weakness, speech difficulties, or other neurological symptoms."
